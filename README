Binary distribution
===================

There is no installation as such. Just unzip to a location you like and launch "CodeBeagle.exe" to start up the UI. If CodeBeagle fails to launch your system probably misses the correct Microsoft Visual C++ runtime. To fix this download and install the "Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable Package (x64)" from Microsoft:
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145

Running from source
===================

The latest version is available from "git://git.code.sf.net/p/codebeagle/code".
First the prerequisites (that's what I used to build the binary distribution):
- Python 3.8.2 (www.python.org)
- PyQt GPL v5.14.2 (install with "pip install pyqt5")
- cx_Freeze (install with "pip install cx_freeze"):
    Only needed if you want convert the python scripts into executables

Python is assumed to be installed in "C:\Program Files\Python38". Compile the user interface and resource files by calling "build.bat". The user interface is launched via "CodeBeagle.pyw". The script to update the index is called "UpdateIndex.py".
To build the executables call "buildexe.bat" which calls "build.bat" itself. To be able to compile the dark theme style sheet you need the sass compiler in your path.

Have fun
